Description
===========

Pure Python library for the Danga (Perl) implementation of Gearman.

See http://www.danga.com/gearman/ for more about Gearman.

Status
======

Stable and production ready.

This is a fork of Samuel Stauffer's "Gearman 1.x" Python library
with the module renamed to "dangagearman" so that it can
be released alongside the "Gearman 2.x" library that's
maintained by Yelp.
